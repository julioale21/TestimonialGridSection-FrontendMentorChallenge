                                code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
                                step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who 
                                can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                                agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. I took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                                could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example 
                                of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
